## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am **Sema BetÃ¼l Kocatepe**. I'm a new graduate from YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University.

I like to work on web projects. I like developing both Frontend and Backend side of the projects. The technologies I use are: C#, .NET, Entity Framework, Java, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, HTML, CSS and more.

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning too. I made two projects using Machine Learning models: "Multiple Object Tracking in Video" and "Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis".

I am trying to improve myself every day. I like studying and I'm trying to learn new things.
